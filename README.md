# Data-Viz-Interface

This interface is designed with the D3.js library. Please see the documentation for further details about code syntax or functionality: https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki 

## Data
This folder is updated to only consist of json-files, which is the choice of data format used for the visualizations.

- oxygen.json: *A very basic mocked flow from https://www.mockaroo.com/schemas/new*
- db_flow1.json: *A more realistic attempt on a mocked db flow.*
- db_flow2.json: *Another version of a mocked db flow.*

## Graphs
Each file in this folder should have commented code, to provide enough information. In order to preview the graphs (Not a completed styling!), visit https://soutea.github.io/Data-Viz-Interface/ and add the path to the wanted version. For example, if graph_1.html should be viewed, visit https://soutea.github.io/Data-Viz-Interface/Graphs/graph_1.html

- graph_1.html: *This graph has hardcoded values and is based on the data found in oxygen.json*
- graph_2.html: *This graph hardcoded values and is based on the data found in db_flow2.json*
- graph_generic.html: *This graph has a generic approach and is not available to preview without customization.*
- graph_animated.html: *This graph is outdated and belongs to an older prototype. Has working transitions giving a dynamic toggling.*
